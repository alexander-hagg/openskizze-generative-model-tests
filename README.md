# OpenSkizze Generative Model Tests

This project implements three generative machine learning models to generate 2.5D voxel height maps representing urban planning and massing designs. It includes training scripts, inference scripts, and a GUI application for visualization.

## Models Included

- **3D Generative Adversarial Network (3D-GAN)**
- **Voxel Variational Autoencoder (Voxel VAE)**
- **Autoregressive Model (Voxel RNN)**

## Requirements

Install the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
